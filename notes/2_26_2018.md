## Trade Study

This isn't really in the book.

### Why Perform a Trade Study?

- gather and assess possible design solutions for the new system
- determine whether to make or buy a needed asset/tool/software application
- methodically evaluate attributes & characteristics of each potential design
- reduce uncertainty & risk associated with system development
- arrive at a decision as to which potential design solution will provide a
"balanced" approach that will result in a system that is realizable and 
functional

## Means to Conduct a Trade Study

### Qualitative Approach

- simple
- words to compare alternatives/attributes
- drawback: possible bias when making comparisons (subjectivity)

Conclusion: easy but not always most clean method

### Quantitative Approach

- uses mathematical tools
    - pairwise comparisons, decision trees, or Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
- advantage: less prone to analyst bias (subjectivity)
