## Trade Study

This isn't really in the book.

### Why Perform a Trade Study?

- gather and assess possible design solutions for the new system
- determine whether to make or buy a needed asset/tool/software application
- methodically evaluate attributes & characteristics of each potential design
- reduce uncertainty & risk associated with system development
- arrive at a decision as to which potential design solution will provide a
"balanced" approach that will result in a system that is realizable and 
functional
