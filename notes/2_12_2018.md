## FFBD

FFBD = Functional Flow Block Diagram

Operational overview can show the "50,000 ft" view of a system. An example is
given below. Shows pieces of system together and how thy work/what they do.

## Functional Requirements

- Top-level requirements => functional requirements
- Basis for requirements management
- The "what" of the system
- Function *architecture* is organic/living and increases in detail/complexity
as requirements decomposition progresses
    - Start high-level and moves lower

### FFBD Schema

- Functional requirements are best captured through FFBD
- FFBD is time...
- Employ boolean logic (many times)

## Process Mapping of FFBD Elements

## Benefits/Application of FFBDs

- Identify potential trade study Areas of Opportunity (AOOs)
- Develop, analyze, flow down requirements to lower levels
- Provides better picture of how system under development is intended to
function/work
- Identifies possible areas for operational simplification within the overall
system
