## In-Class Risk Discussion Example

> You are the chief engineer for the "Blast Off" rocket company. During the most
recent Risk Management Board meeting, you were informed that the only supplier
of Unobtanium - a key component in the manufacture of your biggest selling
rocket's nozzle - is having labor union problems.
> 
> Negotiations with the vendor's employees are stalled, and there is a serious
> threat at the supplier within the next 30 days.

Questions to answer

1. Is this a genuine risk, or is it just part of "doing business" for your
company?
2. If it IS a risk, which of the 4 risk handling approaches would you advise
the program manager to use to deal with this risk (avoidance, transfer, 
acceptance, or mitigation)?
3. Which product team should be assigned the job of dealing with this risk?
4. Should your customers be informed of this new risk, and why do you thing
they should be told/not be told about it?
5. If you have chosen to mitigate this new risk, what are some possible
strategies you could use in a plan to reduce this threat to your rocket nozzle
production?
6. How will you get the program manager to support the effort needed (schedule,
cost, employees' time) to reduce this risk?
