Patriot Missile Air Defense System
- anti-missile missile

Scud missiles
- series of different tactile missiles developed by former Soviet Union

## What happened?

A Patriot Missile (Dhahran, Saudi Arabia) to intercept an incoming Scud missile
killing 28 soldiers and injuring 90 more.

## Technical Details

- Had a 24-bit fixed point register
- Patriot Missile's clock ran at 100ms interval
- Multiply by 1/10 to convert to seconds and rest truncated (1/10 is a 
repeating, non-terminating binary number)
- After multiplication, rest of number was truncated leading to a time 
difference that is approximately 0.34 seconds after 100 hours of up time
- This time difference corresponds to an intercept being off by about 0.5km

## How could systems engineering prevented this from happening?

1. Thorough review process and milestones and detailed technical interaction 
between customer and contractor (involving engineers on both sides)
2. Internal review process with company experts
3. Technical documentation that highlights limitations
4. Documentation that is readable by not-so-technical personnel
5. Weekly technical of internal meetings of the contractor
