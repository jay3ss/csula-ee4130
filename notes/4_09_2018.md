## Theory of Constraints

A system has a goal (make money) and there are one or more activities that
act as a constraint on that whole system

> Either you manage constraints, or they manage you...

Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt

Any system can only produce as much as its "critically constrained" resource
(bottleneck)

Constraints can be external or internal
