## What is Risk?

- Probability of failure

### Types of Risk

1. Known known (tip of the iceberg)
2. Known unknown (just beneath the water line)
3. Unknown known (1/3 of the way under)
4. Unknown unknown (bottom 1/3)

#### Known Known

Known risk, but the probability of occurrence known

#### Unknown Unknown

Unknown risk, probability of occurrence unknown

#### Known Unknown

Worst. Someone (in the organization) knows that some risk exists, but doesn't
say anything.
