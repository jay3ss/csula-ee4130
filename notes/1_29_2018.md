## Exercise

Write a problem statement about the need for more student parking capacity at
CSULA.

At peak times, CSULA's parking capacity is severely limited leaving many
students searching for a parking space for more than an hour, potentially
missing class. This is necessary to provide a better quality of life for our 
students and to reduce their opportunity cost.
