## House of Quality

House of Quality (HOQ)

- way to pull out customers' needs and find out what they want

## Technical Performance Measures (TMPs)

- *quantitative values* that describe system performance
- stem from system operational requirements
- Design Dependent Parameters (DDP)
    - when design is finally converged on, parameters drive what performance
    measurements are
    - some examples: failure weight
- can include: weight, envelope, and availability to perform/function as
designed

## Quality Function Deployment (QFD)

- somewhat dated (although still used)
- weighted values for TMPs
    - uses cross-referenced matrices
- **primary goal:** identify what customer *wants*
- *how* to get what customer wants (good/service/process)
- relates wants to ...
- takes place in *preliminary design phase* of system development

## System Design Flow

- goes from abstract notion to a repeatable, producible system/product
- stages (each includes an associated review)
    1. conceptual design
    2. system design
    3. preliminary design
    4. critical design
