## Three Systems Engineering Tasks

- Get requirements
- Design
- Verify requirements

## System Requirements

- Uniform & identifiable process for discovering system requirements
- Requirements emerge throughout system life-cycle (i.e., they can change)

## Requirements Change

- Can't get all requirements upfront
- Requirements are emergent (2nd bullet point above)
- Customer, "I'll know when I see it"
- Customer/stakeholder priorities change over time
- Low-level requirements -> ...

## What is a Stakeholder

- Everyone (people, organizations, etc.) that the system provides some benefit
to

## Understand Customer Needs

- Customers aren't always aware of all details of what they nee
- ...

### Customer Usually Misstates Needs

May try to arrive at solution before actually thinking about problem

## Types of Requirements

- Primary: comes directly from a contractual agreement/commitment from the 
customer
- Derived: comes internally from project/organization that's developing the system

## Requirement Application

How is a particular requirement applied to the system that is being developed?

- Product: imposed on the "physical" product
    - Qualitative: description of what system is going to do
    - Quantitative: e.g., mean time to failure
- Program: applied on the program (concerned with execution)
    - Tasks: developers must do "something"
    - Compliance: how are we going to verify that a requirement has been met 
    (objectively)
        - Mandatory -> "Shall" (must have it, otherwise in violation of contract)
        - Guidance -> "May" or "Will" (nice to have)
        - Information -> "Should"
    - Regulatory: meeting laws/rules

## Dog House Example

Your company is developing a dog house. Come up with some requirements.

- Qualitative
- Quantitative:
    - The dog house shall remain standing during a Category Two storm on the
    Saffir-Simpson scale
    - The dog house shall remain standing after a 6.0 earthquake on the Richter 
    scale

## Requirement Quality

- Complete
- Lack of ambiguity
    - "Shall be affordable" is ambiguous. What is "affordable?"
- Scope
    - Avoid "motherhood" statements ("The dog shall enjoy the dog house")
