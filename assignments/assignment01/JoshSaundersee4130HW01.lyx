Question 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Select a man-made system of your choice (preferably NOT one from the textbook)
 and describe the components, attributes, and relationships between the
 components and attributes of that system you chose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Man-made system:
\series default
 a satellite in geostationary orbit around the earth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Components:
\series default
 communications dish, reaction wheels, on-board computer, solar panels,
 gimbals, radar altimeter

\series bold
Relationships:
\series default
 The communications dish receives commands and transmits these commands
 to the ob-board computer which collects data from the radar altimeter.
 The on-board computer process the telemetry data from the radar altimeter
 and sends it back to the ground via the communications dish.
 The gimbals point the communications dish at the ground station and point
 the radar altimeter at the target.
 The solar panels and power system provide power for the satellite.

Question 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
List some of the likely benefits from using systems thinking and the systems
 engineering process, when developing a new system or product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some likely benefits of using systems thinking and the systems engineering
 process when developing a new system or product:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Allows a new system or product to be viewed from different levels of complexity.
 For example, one can take the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

50,000 ft view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that shows a high-level overview to get a basic idea of how the system
 or product is made.
 Or, one can take a low-level over to see how individual components operate
 and interconnect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Periodic reviews can ensure that the stakeholders and product/system developers
 are in agreement of what the product/system that what is being developed
 is what was intended.

Question 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Of the three systems engineering process models described in the lecture
 in week 1, choose one and explain how it can help in the process of system
 design and synthesisâ€¦
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spiral process is an iterative design process that has several different
 phases.
 At each phase, a different type of prototype is developed.
 The different phases with different prototypes coupled with feedback allows
 for the discovery of what the stakeholders actually want versus what the
 designers think that the stakeholders want.
 Also, it allows a product to be designed that is more consistent with what
 the stakeholders want as well.
 Because it is an adaptation of the waterfall method, the spiral method
 is well suited for large-scale, complicated systems such as satellites
 and aircraft.
